1.1: Use my video camera as input and see the line markers ok
1.2: Input a video and get back an output video that has the line markers ok

2.0: Play around with the coords to check something-> done in the video mode to check if left shoulder is in frame
2.1: Create some sort of easy formula just to check if the exercises are correct(it will be done via 3 states)
2.2: Use those same formulas and apply them to the input video and make the output video have the form check text too
2.3: Make those formulas better and keep testing them on videos.

3.0: Machine learning using SVM with manual checks if the form is ok
3.1: Classify data for examples in pullup "Bent arm on start of pull" via 3 states

4.0: Build a frontend of the application

Extra ideas
State 1: not doing anything -> State 2: Transitioning into the exercise -> State 3: Back up)
Counter of the exercise (both wrong and good, maybe even "partially good")(make the counter label hidden till you do that certain exercise?)
