1.1: Use my video camera as input and see the line markers
1.2: Input a video and get back an output video that has the line markers

2.1: Create some sort of easy formula just to check if the Frontlever angles are correct on CAMERA(1.1)
2.2: Use those same formulas and apply them to the input video and make the output video have the form check text too
2.3: Make those formulas better and keep testing them on videos.

3.0: Find a way to get data from each frame
3.1: Classify data as "bent arm", "good form", "pyked hips"

4.0: Use this data to classify videos like I did on step 2.2
4.1: Build a frontend for the application
